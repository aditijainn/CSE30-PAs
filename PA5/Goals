The goals of PA5 are:
Additional practice writing code using C pointers, strings, arrays of pointers to strings
working with command line options using getopt() (library function)
Basic memory runtime memory allocation and deallocation with malloc() and free().
Using the linux tool valgrind to test if your use of malloc() and free() is correct.
More practice with modifying code you did not write (something you will do a whole lot of when you graduate).

In Part 1: you will use the code you wrote in PA4 (main.c and token.c) and add support for quoted data fields in token() with no change to your main.c.

 In Part 2: you will write a new main() routine (from starter code) and add a new function wrtrow() in the file wrtrow.c. The following functionality will be added:
Add the ability to process different field separator characters (other than the ,) on the input file.
Implement data reformatting operations to output a new DSV file based on the data contained in each data record in the input DSV file. 
The program will be able to select a subset (from 1 to  all) of the input data fields to output
The program will be able to output these selected input data fields in any order (and duplicate input fields in the output as well)
The program will be able to specify a different field separator character in the output DSV ( comma , is the default).
