PA8 is the first part of a two part project where you will be working on a program called cipher. Cipher is a file encryption/decryption program that uses a variation of what is called a book cipher. Cipher will both encrypt and decrypt any type of file (text and binary) using a combination of per byte bit manipulation (using bitwise operations) and an exclusive or (EOR in arm ^ in C) encoding using sequence of bytes from a book file (traditionally a real book, but it can be any text or binary file).
cipher reads the file to be processed from standard input, either encrypts or decrypts the file, and then writes the result to standard output. Cipher has two required arguments:
A flag that specifies on of either  encrypt (-e) or decrypt (-d) operational mode
A flag -b  <filename> that specifies the name of the book file that contains the encoding keys
