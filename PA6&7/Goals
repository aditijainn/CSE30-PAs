PA6 is the first part of a two part project where you will be working on an in-memory parking ticket database. The data we are using is actual data summons (ticket) data extracted from the New York City summons database for the fiscal year 2018 (~July 2018 to ~June 2019). In PA6 you will be writing four routines to replace ones provided with the starter code. In PA7 you will be writing two more. 
Practice in writing data structures in C using pointers combined with self-referential structures
Basic memory runtime memory allocation and deallocation with malloc() and free().
Using the linux tool valgrind to test if your use of malloc() and free() is correct.
Working with hash table chains and 2-dimensional linked lists.
Writing code to traverse every record in a database to find a specific entry
Writing code to use a hash function to find a specific entry in the database
Practice doing incremental code development in the context of a fully operational program (something you will do a whole lot of when you graduate), by writing replacement routines for existing ones.
